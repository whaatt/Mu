Mu
=============
An Implementation of Anonymous Functions in Python.

- Written in pure Python 3.
- Importable as a module.

### File Notes
- All useful files are located in /mu.
- The file containing the the tool itself is mu.py.
- The file example.py contains some use cases.
- The file clean.py is a clean version of the code.
- The file clean.py may not work as you expect it to.

### Features
- It's a lot like Python's ```lambda``` construct.
- Multiple lines are allowed in a function.
- Constructs are fully supported, AFAIK.

### Usage
- Use the variable ```a``` to access function arguments.
- You must pass multiple parameters as arrays though.
- Use the function ```t``` for doing recursion.
- Separate every single line with semicolons.
- In place of tabs for constructs, use a colon.

### Warning
- Do not use ```mu``` and what you imported it as for variable names.
- Please avoid variables with leading and trailing triple underscores.

### Name
- Can you figure out why this is named Mu?
- Look at the Greek alphabet for a hint.
